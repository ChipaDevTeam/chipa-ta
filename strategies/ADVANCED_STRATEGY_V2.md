# Advanced Strategy V2: Multi-Indicator Confluence

This document outlines a sophisticated trading strategy that leverages a combination of trend-following, momentum, and oscillator indicators to generate high-probability trading signals. The core principle is **confluence**, meaning that a trade is only initiated when multiple, diverse indicators align to support the same directional bias.

## I. Strategy Overview

- **Strategy Type**: Trend-following and momentum-based.
- **Objective**: To capture significant market trends by entering on pullbacks or breakouts that are confirmed by multiple layers of analysis.
- **Timeframe**: Suitable for intermediate-term trading (e.g., 4-hour to daily charts), but adaptable to other timeframes.
- **Core Indicators**:
  - **Trend**: Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) - 50-period and 200-period.
  - **Momentum**: Relative Strength Index (RSI) - 14-period.
  - **Oscillator**: Awesome Oscillator (AO) - default periods (5, 34).

## II. Strategy Logic â€“ Entry and Exit Conditions

### A. Long Entry Conditions (Strong Buy Signal)

All of the following conditions must be met simultaneously:

1.  **Primary Trend Confirmation (Bullish)**:

    - The current price is **above** the 200-period EMA, indicating a long-term uptrend.
    - The 50-period EMA is **above** the 200-period EMA (a "golden cross" formation), confirming sustained bullish momentum.

2.  **Momentum Confirmation (Bullish)**:

    - The RSI is **above 55**, signaling strong bullish momentum and that the asset is not yet overbought.

3.  **Oscillator Confirmation (Bullish)**:

    - The Awesome Oscillator (AO) is **above the zero line**, indicating that short-term momentum is greater than long-term momentum.

4.  **MACD Confirmation (Bullish)**:

    - The MACD line is **above** its signal line, indicating bullish momentum.

5.  **Bollinger Bands (BB) Confirmation (Bullish)**:

    - The price is near the **lower Bollinger Band**, suggesting a potential reversal to the upside.

6.  **Keltner Channel (KC) Confirmation (Bullish)**:

    - The price is near the **lower Keltner Channel band**, indicating a possible bounce.

7.  **SuperTrend Confirmation (Bullish)**:
    - The SuperTrend is **bullish** (price is above the SuperTrend line), confirming the uptrend.

### B. Short Entry Conditions (Strong Sell Signal)

All of the following conditions must be met simultaneously:

1.  **Primary Trend Confirmation (Bearish)**:

    - The current price is **below** the 200-period EMA, indicating a long-term downtrend.
    - The 50-period EMA is **below** the 200-period EMA (a "death cross" formation), confirming sustained bearish momentum.

2.  **Momentum Confirmation (Bearish)**:

    - The RSI is **below 45**, signaling strong bearish momentum and that the asset is not yet oversold.

3.  **Oscillator Confirmation (Bearish)**:

    - The Awesome Oscillator (AO) is **below the zero line**, indicating that short-term momentum is weaker than long-term momentum.

4.  **MACD Confirmation (Bearish)**:

    - The MACD line is **below** its signal line, indicating bearish momentum.

5.  **Bollinger Bands (BB) Confirmation (Bearish)**:

    - The price is near the **upper Bollinger Band**, suggesting a potential reversal to the downside.

6.  **Keltner Channel (KC) Confirmation (Bearish)**:

    - The price is near the **upper Keltner Channel band**, indicating a possible drop.

7.  **SuperTrend Confirmation (Bearish)**:
    - The SuperTrend is **bearish** (price is below the SuperTrend line), confirming the downtrend.

### C. Exit Conditions

- **For a Long Position**: The position is held until the "Short Entry Conditions" are met, signaling a complete reversal of the market structure.
- **For a Short Position**: The position is held until the "Long Entry Conditions" are met.
- **No Signal**: If neither the long nor short conditions are met, the strategy remains in a **Hold** state, taking no new action.

## III. Additional Indicators

To further enhance the robustness of the strategy, the following indicators have been integrated:

1. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**:

   - Long Condition: MACD line is above its signal line.
   - Short Condition: MACD line is below its signal line.

2. **Bollinger Bands (BB)**:

   - Long Condition: Price is near the lower Bollinger Band.
   - Short Condition: Price is near the upper Bollinger Band.

3. **Keltner Channel (KC)**:

   - Long Condition: Price is near the lower Keltner Channel band.
   - Short Condition: Price is near the upper Keltner Channel band.

4. **SuperTrend**:
   - Long Condition: SuperTrend is bullish (price is above the SuperTrend line).
   - Short Condition: SuperTrend is bearish (price is below the SuperTrend line).

## IV. Strategy Implementation

The strategy is implemented as a composable `StrategyNode` in Rust, leveraging the `Condition` enum to define complex logical expressions. Below is the Rust code for the strategy:

```rust
use chipa_ta::{
    error::TaResult,
    strategy::{Action, Condition, MarketData, StrategyNode},
    types::OutputType,
    Indicator,
};

fn advanced_strategy_v2() -> TaResult<StrategyNode> {
    // --- INDICATORS ---
    // Trend
    let ema_long = Indicator::ema(200)?;
    let ema_short = Indicator::ema(50)?;

    // Momentum
    let rsi = Indicator::rsi(14)?;
    let ao = Indicator::ao(5, 34)?; // Default periods for Awesome Oscillator

    // Additional Indicators
    let macd = Indicator::macd(12, 26, 9)?;
    let bb = Indicator::bb(20, 2.0)?;
    let kc = Indicator::kc(20, 2.0)?;
    let super_trend = Indicator::super_trend(3.0, 10)?;

    // --- LONG CONDITIONS (BUY) ---
    let long_conditions = Condition::And(vec![
        // 1. Major trend is up: Price is above the long-term moving average.
        Condition::LessThan {

            value: OutputType::Close, // equivalent to Close > EMA(200)
        },
        // 2. Short-term trend is also up: Price is above the short-term moving average.
        Condition::LessThan {

            value: OutputType::Close,
        },
        // 7. Price is near the lower Keltner Channel band.
        Condition::LessThan {
            indicator: kc.clone(),
            value: OutputType::Close,
        },
        // 8. SuperTrend is bullish.
        Condition::LessThan {
            indicator: super_trend.clone(),
            value: OutputType::Close,
        },
    ]);

    // --- SHORT CONDITIONS (SELL) ---
    let short_conditions = Condition::And(vec![
        // 1. Major trend is down: Price is below the long-term moving average.
        Condition::GreaterThan {
            indicator: ema_long,
            value: OutputType::Close, // equivalent to Close < EMA(200)
        },
        // 2. Short-term trend is also down: Price is below the short-term moving average.
        Condition::GreaterThan {
            indicator: ema_short,
            value: OutputType::Close, // equivalent to Close < EMA(50)
        },
        // 3. Bearish momentum is confirmed: RSI is in the bearish zone.
        Condition::LessThan {
            indicator: rsi,
            value: OutputType::Single(45.0),
        },
        // 4. Awesome Oscillator confirms bearish momentum.
        Condition::LessThan {
            indicator: ao,
            value: OutputType::Single(0.0),
        },

        // 8. SuperTrend is bearish.
        Condition::GreaterThan {
            indicator: super_trend,
            value: OutputType::Close,
        },

            else_branch: Some(Box::new(StrategyNode::Action(Action::Hold))),
        })),
    };

    Ok(strategy)
}

```

This implementation defines a nested `If` structure. The outer `If` checks for the `long_conditions`. If they are met, it produces a `StrongBuy` action. If not, it proceeds to the `else_branch`, which contains another `If` node to check for the `short_conditions`. This ensures a clear, hierarchical evaluation of market conditions.
